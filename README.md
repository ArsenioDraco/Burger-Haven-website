# Burger-Haven-website.
This website is supposed to mimick a non-existant website of a burger restraunt called "Burger Haven". It's unique feature is that it's intentionally made to mimick how websites looked in 2005. 
The inspiration came from how many modern japanese websites still have the appeareance of older websites from the 2000's.
